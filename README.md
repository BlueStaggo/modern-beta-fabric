Moderner Beta is the successor of [b3spectacled](https://github.com/b3spectacled)'s [Modern Beta](https://github.com/b3spectacled/modern-beta-fabric). It originally started as a pull request for the original Modern Beta to add in world generation from Beta 1.8 to 1.6.4, however due to b3spectacled's inactivity it has become its own project. The mod is currently supported for 1.20.1, 1.21 and 1.21.2.

## Features
In addition to everything in Modern Beta...
- Support for NeoForge in addition to Fabric
- Graphical settings menu for every customizable option
- World generation from Beta 1.8 up to Release 1.6 with experimental support for 1.7 to 1.17 generation
- Additional world generation from Infdev 20100325, Classic 0.0.14a_08 and Beta 1.1
- Fixed surface rules for Beta Vanilla and 1.12.2 presets
- Highly customisable biome layout for Beta 1.8+ versions
